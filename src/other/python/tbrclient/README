===  SUMMARY  ===
This directory contains the files needed to generate a Python wrapper of 
the tbrclient library.

===  ABOUT TBRCLIENT  ===
The tbrclient library is a C++ library for communicating with tbrprobe.  
For more information about tbrclient, look in snowbots/src/tbrclient/.

===  USING TBRCLIENT IN PYTHON  ===
In order to use tbrclient in a Python program, you have to generate a 
"wrapper" module around the C++ library.  The files in this directory will
do that for you automatically using SWIG, so you must have SWIG installed on 
your computer first.  To install SWIG, use your package manager to install 
"swig".  Then just type "make" in this directory.  This will create the Python 
module and supporting shared object (.so file) and move them up one directory 
(into snowbots/src/python/).  From there you can just "import tbrclient" into 
your Python program and away you go.

===  REQUIRED PACKAGES  ===
swig
python-dev
build-essential

===  EXAMPLES  ===
See python/sonar_avoid.py for an example robot AI that uses tbrclient.
