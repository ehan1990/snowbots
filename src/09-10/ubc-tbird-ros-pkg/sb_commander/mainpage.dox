\b sb_commander contains commander nodes.  These are the nodes that take
recommendations from the analysis nodes and make the final decisions about
the robot's actions.

The root directory of this package is also a good place for roslaunch XML
files (*.launch).  roslaunch provides a convenient way to launch all of 
the nodes required by a robot from a single command, as well as options
for setting the environment variables available to those nodes.


\section codeapi Code API

<!--
Provide links to specific auto-generated API documentation within your
package that is of particular interest to a reader. Doxygen will
document pretty much every part of your code, so do your best here to
point the reader to the actual API.

If your codebase is fairly large or has different sets of APIs, you
should use the doxygen 'group' tag to keep these APIs together. For
example, the roscpp documentation has 'libros' group.
