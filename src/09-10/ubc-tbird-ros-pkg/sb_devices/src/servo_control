# READ ME!
# When servo_control.cpp is compiled, it will generate the executable
# bin/_servo_control -- note the leading underscore.  (You can see this 
# for yourself in the CMakeLists.txt file).  Why the leading underscore?
#
# It's there because you're not supposed to run the binary executable
# directly; instead, run this script.  Give it the name of the servo you 
# want the node to control as an argument, and this script will run the 
# binary _servo_control node with the correct remappings.  For example, 
# if you type:
#   rosrun sb_devices servo_control throttle
# then the servo_control node will subscribe to topic "throttle" and
# be named "servo_control_throttle".  This allows you to run several 
# instances of servo_control for controlling multiple servos.
#
# For more info on ROS remapping, see
