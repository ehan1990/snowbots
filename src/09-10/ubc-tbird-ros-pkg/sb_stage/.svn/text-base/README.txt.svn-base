***Installing Stage***

In order to install a stage-simulator to run ROS nodes on, you DO NOT need to go thorugh all the pain to install "playerstage" and finally get it not working properly!

Rather, use the following command to get it installed:

	sudo apt-get install ros-boxturtle-simulator-stage

this command installs a version of stage on your ubuntu
